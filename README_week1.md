I used the wireframe palette from the video and wanted to create a gallery of my drawings. I also included a video of an artist that I really liked- Gustav Klimt. I mostly followed step by step while watching the videos. It all went well in the beginning and I have also used something I learnt from the previous assignment such as creating a gradient on the background. However, I could not make the animation happen. I have checked through every link in both the html and css but it simply did not show up. I can see that it did exist from the console but the png was not there. So I really need help with that. I also linked more information to my personal website where I keep most of my works as a portfolio. 

I did not realize that we had to choose a prompt from the list until I finished the assignment, and I did not have time to make a new one so apologize for that.

Here is the wireframe I drew on iPad.
