        <h2> Wearable Art</h2>
        <p> For this project, I continued working with the 3D printers from the previous project 
            and extended to make real wearables. There's one printer on the floor that prints 
            TPU material, which is soft and flexible. So I decided to make a dress out of the 
            material. I started out by researching Issey Miyake's technology-driven fabrics and 
            designed my own pattern for the fabric.

        <p> I designed the pattern in Tinkercad and printed it with the TPU material. However, 
            it is a bit more difficult to print with that material because it would not dry hard 
            quickly and gets tangled up easily. Therefore, while the printer was doing the job, 
            I had to keep checking on the status and clean up the surface whenever there is a knot.</p>
